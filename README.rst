Pebbles
****************

**Pebbles** (formerly Pouta Blueprints) is a tool to provision and manage resources in the cloud. 
Currently supported resource types are:

- `OpenStack driver`_,
  which can be used to launch instances on OpenStack cloud.
- `Docker driver`_,
  for running web notebook instances in Docker containers on a pool of virtual machines. 
    
Additional resources can be added by implementing the driver interface. 

Documentation
=============

`Documentation hosted on GitHub
<http://cscfi.github.io/pebbles/>`_.

`Documentation hosted on readthedocs
<http://pebbles.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

The documentation is generated from Sphinx RST documentation under doc/ and
inline in the code. Convention is to write docstrings as much as possible
close to the code that implements said functionality. Module level docstrings
can be used to give end-user readable generic description of system parts.
Things that aren't naturally tied to a code module or artefact can be created
under doc/source. 

Building the documentation can be one as follows ::

        $ mkvirtualenv pb-doc
        (pb-doc) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        (pb-doc) $ cd doc && make html

Will build the html documentation under doc/build. There is a requirement of
graphviz for creating system structure graphs.

The documentation is hosted in GitHub pages and built using `Travis-Sphinx`_.
Travis-Sphinx requires your documentation to be 100% correct RST syntax to
build so it's worth the effort to run the following before pushing nontrivial 
documentation changes for Travis testing. ::

        $ workon pb-doc
        $ yum install graphviz
        (pb-doc)$ travis-sphinx --branches=doc/sphinx --source=doc/source build
